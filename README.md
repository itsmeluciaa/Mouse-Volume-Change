# Mouse Volume Change

This is an AutoHotkey script that alows you to change your system volume with your mouse.

I wanted to be able to change my system volume by using the scroll wheel on my mouse, so i decided to make this script.

I will explain exactly how you can use this with your mouse, and change which mouse buttons will change your volume.

## How To Use
1. First Decide If you would like eighter pressing one mouse button and at the samne time scrolling up, to change your volume. Or if you would like to press one button and scroll at the same time to do volume up, and another button+ scroll to do volume down. Select the correct file accordingly. (theres two, 1 Button is the first option, 2 Buttons is the second option.)


## Disclamer
Please note that even tho there is code to prevent false anti cheat flags, some games might not like seeing your script running.

Altho the only game that ever asked me to close the script was Battlefield 6, i still wanted to mention this.
