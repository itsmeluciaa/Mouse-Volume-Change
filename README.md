# Mouse Volume Change

This is an AutoHotkey script that alows you to change your system volume with your mouse.

I wanted to be able to change my system volume by using the scroll wheel on my mouse, so i decided to make this script.

I will explain exactly how you can use this with your mouse, and change which mouse buttons will change your volume.

## How To Use
1. First, decide how you want to control your volume:

    Option 1: Press one mouse button and simultaneously scroll up or down to adjust the volume.
   
    Option 2: Use one button + scroll for volume up, and another button + scroll for volume down.

Then, select the corresponding script file:

    For Option 1, choose the "1-Button" script.
    For Option 2, go with the "2-Buttons" script.



## Disclamer
Please note that even tho there is code to prevent false anti cheat flags, some games might not like seeing your script running.

Altho the only game that ever asked me to close the script was Battlefield 6, i still wanted to mention this.
