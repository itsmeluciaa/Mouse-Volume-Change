# Mouse Volume Change

This is an AutoHotkey script that alows you to change your system volume with your mouse.

I wanted to be able to change my system volume by using the scroll wheel on my mouse, so i decided to make this script.


## How To Use
1. First, decide how you want to control your volume:

    Option 1: Press one mouse button and simultaneously scroll up or down to adjust the volume.
   
    Option 2: Use XButton1 + scroll for volume down, and XButton2 + scroll for volume up.
   
    Option 2.1: Use XButton2 + scroll for volume down, and XButton1 + scroll for volume up.

XButton1= 4th mouse button. Typically performs the same function as Browser_Back.

XButton2= 5th mouse button. Typically performs the same function as Browser_Forward.

   
Then, select the corresponding script file:

    For Option 1, choose the "1-Button" .exe.
    For Option 2, go with the "2-Button-XButton1-VolDown" .exe.
    For Option 2.1, go with the "2-Button-XButton2-VolDown .exe.



## Disclamer
Please not that all above .exe's use Unicode 64.

Please note that even tho there is code to prevent false anti cheat flags, some games might not like seeing your script running.

Altho the only game that ever asked me to close the script was Battlefield 6, i still wanted to mention this.
